intro: "The first immersive communication and posture course in Romania. It combines public speaking techniques and the art of authentic storytelling with body-awareness techniques to improve how you communicate and present yourself."
program:
  - dayTitle: "Day 1 — What & Why We Speak"
    content: "Before we communicate, we align — with structure, with posture. Focus: We begin with the why behind our words — and the body that carries them. Because every message lives not just in language, but in how we stand, breathe, and show up."
  - dayTitle: "Day 2 — How We Move and Show Up"
    content: "Your body speaks before your mouth does. What is it saying? Focus: Your voice isn't just sound — it's posture, tension, movement, intention. We explore how the way we move, stand, and hold tension shapes how we show up and how we're heard."
  - dayTitle: "Day 3 — The Message & The Mirror"
    content: "Your story becomes real when you speak it into space — and see yourself reflected back. Focus: We move from construction to delivery. From inner work to outer presence. It's about embodying your message — and letting it land with clarity, simplicity, and impact."
  - dayTitle: "Day 4 — Secret Garden Talks"
    content: "Hidden behind an interwar villa, part of Romania's cultural heritage, the Secret Garden at Arome 22 is more than a setting — it's a quiet witness to voice, presence, and story. The finale: In a relaxed, talk‑style gathering, we share stories shaped by practice, celebrate with ease, and express without pressure."
