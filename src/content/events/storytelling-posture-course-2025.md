Participants will learn how to use their voice, body, and personal stories to create a genuine connection with the audience. The program includes storytelling and posture exercises, along with social sessions, a handwriting workshop, and posture‑correction and relaxation workshops, in a setting that fosters confidence and authenticity.

## Course program

### Day 1 — What & Why We Speak

Before we communicate, we align — with structure, with posture. Focus We begin with the why behind our words — and the body that carries them. Because every message lives not just in language, but in how we stand, breathe, and show up.

**Key objectives:**
- Clarify the purpose behind your message
- Understand basic narrative structure
- Begin to observe how posture impacts expression
- Build grounded presence — verbal and physical

**Workshop highlights — Story Construction:**
- What are you saying — and why does it matter?
- Narrative tools that bring structure and clarity
- Quiet handwriting session: your message, on paper

**Golden hour:** We close the work with Q&A and a glass of prosecco. A moment to reflect, breathe, and exhale together.

**Evening flow:** After dinner, the formal ends — the tribe begins. Casual games, stories, and relaxed connection around the table.

### Day 2 — How We Move and Show Up

Your body speaks before your mouth does. What is it saying? Focus Your voice isn't just sound — it's posture, tension, movement, intention. We explore how the way we move, stand, and hold tension shapes how we show up and how we're heard.

**Key objectives:**
- Learn how confidence begins in the body
- Connect your voice to physical expression
- Speak with your full body — not just your head
- Experience what it means to move like you mean it

**Workshop highlights:**
- Posture & Presence Practice — breath, grounding, alignment on the beach
- Embodied Storytelling — confidence through stillness and motion
- Exercises that connect voice, body, and truth + partnered exploration & feedback

**Reflection flow:** A quiet afternoon to integrate. Write. Record. Watch yourself back — with presence, not judgment.

**Evening experience:** Long table, Tatar flavors, and barefoot dancing. Laughter, music, and tribe under the night sky.

### Day 3 — The Message & The Mirror

Your story becomes real when you speak it into space — and see yourself reflected back. Focus We move from construction to delivery. From inner work to outer presence. It's about embodying your message — and letting it land with clarity, simplicity, and impact.

**Key objectives:**
- Refine and simplify your narrative
- Practice delivering your message with presence
- Receive clear, supportive feedback
- Explore the visual shape of your story
- Anchor posture into delivery — not performance

**Workshop highlights:**
- Posture Reset at the Beach: Breath, alignment, and physical grounding
- Presence through movement before the message lands
- Feedback in pairs: what's clear, what's alive
- Visual mapping: what holds your story together

**Golden hour:** Time to soften, stretch, float. Let the story settle in the body. Pool, sea, garden, or simply stillness.

**Evening experience:** Dinner by firelight. Toasts, gentle sharing, and unrushed connection. The kind of night that asks for nothing — and offers enough.

### Day 4 — Secret Garden Talks

Hidden behind an interwar villa, part of Romania's cultural heritage, the Secret Garden at Arome 22 is more than a setting — it's a quiet witness to voice, presence, and story. Not in the spotlight, but in the natural light of the garden, we close the circle — with posture aligned, voices open, and messages ready to be shared.

**The finale:** In a relaxed, talk‑style gathering, we share stories shaped by practice, celebrate with ease, and express without pressure. Energized by Arome 22 and nourished by local food, we close with presence, connection, and one last shared breath.
