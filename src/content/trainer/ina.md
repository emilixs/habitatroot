With almost 15 years of experience in communication training, Ina brings a unique blend of expertise from sports discipline, acting, and improvisation to create engaging and transformative learning experiences.

Her approach focuses on helping individuals discover their authentic voice and develop the confidence to communicate with genuine presence.
